	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h4><strong>v2.0.5</strong></h4>
	<ul class="space1889list">
		<li>Dice dialog improvements:&nbsp;</li>
		<ul>
			<li>for primary attribute rolls: Toggle whether to use single or double primary attribute value, display of resulting dice count, as well as tooltip for dice count in chat explaining about composition</li>
			<li>The dialogs now have the option whether the roll should be done publicly, privately or privately &amp; SL</li>
		</ul>
		<li>New setting option: The player can now choose to display the modification dialog for every attribute roll, regardless of whether the [SHIFT] or [CTRL] keys were pressed.</li>
		<li>Bugfix: missing damage output for counterattacks like "Counterstrike" and "Riposte".</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h4><strong>v2.0.4</strong></h4>
	<ul class="space1889list">
		<li>New customizable key combination for closing the active window. The default assignment is the ESC key, which prevents Foundry's usual behavior of closing all open windows, including minimized ones, when the ESC key is pressed. If you want the ESC key to work as it used to, you need to assign a different key combination to the function to close the active window.<br>Thanks to Forien on Discord for sharing the source code.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h4><strong>v2.0.3</strong></h4>
	<ul class="space1889list">
		<li>New option in the settings to treat NPCs like PCs. When active, NPCs are not defeated at 0 health, but die at -5 health, just like characters.</li>
		<li>Weapons can now cause special effects that are applied additionally or exclusively on hitting. An example of this is the flamethrower now included in the compendium.</li>
		<li>New ammunition type chemicals and associated capacity type tank.</li>
		<li>New external link to the armory, available via the Foudry icon in the upper left corner<br><img class="profile-img artwork" style="border: none;" src="systems/space1889/icons/vttLogo.webp" width="45"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img class="profile-img artwork" style="border: none;" src="systems/space1889/icons/zeughaus1889.png" width="25"></li>
		<li>Fix: Attacks with area damage weapons are now only successful when they exceed the defense test, not already at a tie.</li>
		<li>Fix: Auto Defense Area Damage: Deductions/surcharges are now calculated correctly, giving large creatures less area damage and small creatures more. Previously it was incorrectly the other way around.</li>
		<li>Fix: V11 the "dead marker" automatically generated by damage now also covers the entire token, as with V10</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h4><strong>v2.0.2</strong></h4>
	<ul class="space1889list">
		<li>New option in the settings to define the indentation depth of the folders and subfolders</li>
		<li>
			<p><em class="fad fa-cogs" style="width: 25px;"> </em>List of suggested modules, available via the Foundry icon in the top left corner</p>

	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h4><strong>v2.0.1</strong></h4>
	<ul class="space1889list">
		<li>
			<p>The sheets of characters, NPCs, creatures and vehicles now have two new text fields:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>GM Info: Is visible only to the game master, even if the players are owners of the actor.</li>
				<li>Player Info: Is visible and editable for players even if they have limited rights to the actor. However, editing with limited rights only works if the game master is logged into the game.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Fix: The effect paralyzed now also affects the values in the character sheet, in that the active defense drops to 0 and this is included in all derived values. Paralyzed also means that full defense is no longer possible.</li>
		<li>Fix: Negative health now automatically affects the secondary and parts of the primary (strength and dexterity) according to the rules. This also includes the special defensive maneuvers like Parry and co.</li>
		<li>Fix: Effects in Foundry V11</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h4><strong>v2.0.0</strong></h4>
	<ul class="space1889list">
		<li>Foundry VTT V10 and V11 support&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Introduction of the new item type "<em>Container / Storage location</em>". This replaces the old body/backpack/storage assignment, relocating items is still possible by clicking on the displayed location, or by drag &amp; drop. The order of the containers in the character sheet can also be changed via drag &amp; drop onto other containers.</li>
		<li>All actors are automatically converted when switching to this version. If you import actors from older versions or from compendiums you created yourself, everything that was previously in the storage or backpack will first end up on the body. If you drag these actors into a scene and select them, you can trigger the conversion manually using the following chat command:<code><br>/addContainer</code></li>
		<li>The actor's current load is now calculated including the containers carried, and the Maluses from overloading flows directly into the attributes, and thus into all rolls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Weapons can now only be drawn or reloaded if they are carried by the player. Exceptions are of course the guns, which are much too big and heavy to be carried.</li>
		<li>Space menu&nbsp;<em class="far fa-hand-rock" style="width: 25px; float: left;"> </em><em>Ready the weapons</em>: &nbsp;</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Function can now also be applied to selected characters only</li>
