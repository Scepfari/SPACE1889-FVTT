			<p>The sheets of characters, NPCs, creatures and vehicles now have two new text fields:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>GM Info: Is visible only to the game master, even if the players are owners of the actor.</li>
				<li>Player Info: Is visible and editable for players even if they have limited rights to the actor. However, editing with limited rights only works if the game master is logged into the game.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Fix: The effect paralyzed now also affects the values in the character sheet, in that the active defense drops to 0 and this is included in all derived values. Paralyzed also means that full defense is no longer possible.</li>
		<li>Fix: Negative health now automatically affects the secondary and parts of the primary (strength and dexterity) according to the rules. This also includes the special defensive maneuvers like Parry and co.</li>

	<ul class="space1889list">
		<li>Foundry VTT V10 and V11 support&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Introduction of the new item type "<em>Container / Storage location</em>". This replaces the old body/backpack/storage assignment, relocating items is still possible by clicking on the displayed location, or by drag &amp; drop. The order of the containers in the character sheet can also be changed via drag &amp; drop onto other containers.</li>
		<li>All actors are automatically converted when switching to this version. If you import actors from older versions or from compendiums you created yourself, everything that was previously in the storage or backpack will first end up on the body. If you drag these actors into a scene and select them, you can trigger the conversion manually using the following chat command:<code><br>/addContainer</code></li>
		<li>The actor's current load is now calculated including the containers carried, and the Maluses from overloading flows directly into the attributes, and thus into all rolls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Weapons can now only be drawn or reloaded if they are carried by the player. Exceptions are of course the guns, which are much too big and heavy to be carried.</li>
