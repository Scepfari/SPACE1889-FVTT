	</div>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h4><strong>v1.4.3</strong></h4>
	<ul class="space1889list">
		<li>Display a confirmation dialog when attacking if combat support is active and no target or a dead target is selected.</li>
		<li>Attack via the <em>Assassin </em>talent is now correctly evaluated as a weapon attack, i.e. the system checks if a melee weapon is held in the hand and uses the one with the most damage considering the <em>Dual Wield</em> talent.</li>
		<li>Bugfix: <em>SPACE 1889 Wurf</em> macro does not work (<a href="https://github.com/Scepfari/SPACE1889-FVTT/issues/18">#18</a>)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h4><strong>v1.4.2</strong></h4>
	<ul class="space1889list">
		<li>Custom SPACE 1889 style for more immersion.<br>Can be turned off and on in the game settings</li>
		<li>Tokens are now subject to movement restrictions if they have at least one of the states <em>Prone</em>, <em>Stunned</em>, <em>Paralyzed</em>, or <em>Unconscious</em>. In this case, the player can no longer move the token until all these states have been removed.</li>
		<li>The game master can also activate this movement restriction for himself, either in the game settings or faster via the configurable key combination [Ctrl + B]. Regardless of this setting, he can always move figures if they also have the <em>Dead </em>state.</li>
		<li>Special list type, in which the dots are replaced by Mars spheres, as in this listing. To use it you have to switch to the source code in the editor, find the right place of the enumeration and replace the list tag<br><code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> with<br><code>&lt;ul class="space1889list"&gt;</code></li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h4><strong>v1.4.1</strong></h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Space menu extended by two options:
			<ul>
				<li>Ready the weapons for all NPCs in a scene, asking whether melee or ranged weapons should be preferred. The weapon with the highest damage is chosen. The corresponding messages in the chat are whispered to the SL.&nbsp;</li>
				<li>The display of the life bars and the token names can now be set for all tokens of a scene.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>When placing tokens on the scene, the system checks if the actor behind the token is already on the scene and if the token is linked to the actor. If this is the case and the token is under the exclusive control of the SL, a dialog appears where the linking can be removed. This also changes the prototype token of the actor.</li>
		<li>The Foundry pause image has been replaced with an animated one.&nbsp;</li>

			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Foundry Anvil logo extended by Space 1889 in the upper left corner</li>
		<li>The logo is clickable and opens a window with useful external links, like the GitHub page for submitting bug reports or feature requests, or the link to the Foundry Discord server.</li>
